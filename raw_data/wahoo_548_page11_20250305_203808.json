      "content": "I received my bike within 4 working days of shipment notice. The unboxing was clean & no damage was present. Assembly was easy & I was soon ready to jump on & try it. The Wahoo app did a nice job of capturing my existing road bike to suggest settings for the fit of the Kickr Bike. The bike worked without issue & was ready to connect to my chosen cycling app. Once I resolved some connection issues on the cycling app side of things, the bike now connects quickly and so far with no problems. \n\nThe bike itself is much more solid than I expected. It's got a good feel to it & enough give in the right ways to feel like you're riding outdoors. Once I got connected into the cycling app, I was amazed at the feel as the bike raises & lowers as the terrain goes by. You really can feel the road dips/raises & while you can't steer (yet), your body will lean like you can. One of the features I really like is the ability to select your own cassettes. Not only are some standard cassettes available but you can customize any cassette you like & change it on the fly with the Wahoo app. Very handy for tough virtual climbs. The shifters work nicely & while the gear display is not in the easiest place to see, it's not terrible either. Not sure where else I'd put it that would be out of the way of your hands and sweat drops.\n\nAll in all, while the bike is on the high end of the cost spectrum, it really is nice to be able to just jump on and go. It's a solid piece of equipment and the incline/decline features give it a real world feel. I've ridden it everyday since I got it so that should tell you a little something. I'm happy with my purchase & glad I opted for the high end for the extra 'bells and whistles'. It's only been a week so we'll see how it's longevity fairs over time.",

The install and setup of the bike was very straight forward using the app. I joined Zwift and got the bike connected with no issues at all. At first I did not seem to get the uphill/downhill working but looking in YouTube I found the setting I was missing. Me and my wife have now been using the bike for a week and we love it! My only compliant thus far is that the bike rattles on the floor if you really pound it even if we are on the lower scale weight wise (58kg & 65kg). I previously owned a kettler racer s bike and base/legs just didn't move/rattle no matter what. I have the bike sit on 1.9cm rubber Gym flooring, which I am hoping won't get damaged. Other than although certainly pricey this it is a great purchase providing Wahoo continue to offer software support and updates over the years to come (don't pull a Sonos style policy or you'll lose customer loyalty!) to keep the bike compatible with the major virtual cycling apps such as Zwift.

      "content": "I have logged a dozen or so rides now on the Wahoo Bike. Because of weather and schedule demands I log more than half of my total miles and 2/3 of my rides a year on the trainer and Zwift. \nThe great: whomever designed the software-based shifting and ride quality deserves a gold star. It really replicates the feel of shifting and accuracy of gearing with my outdoor bike. And I love that I don't have to worry about a chain, or a derailleur getting out of adjustment etc. It is truly exceptional in this area. Overall it is a much better experience than a classic direct drive smart trainer with a standard bike, and I thought that experience was already good. Setup was quite easy. I used the output from my Guru fit and it felt just like my outside bike with exception that for some reason the saddle height was at least 2 inches off but easy enough to adjust. \nThe not-so-great: With a price tag of $3,500, one would think that Wahoo would include something better than a $5 saddle. The bar and bar-tape are not much better. My assumption is they assume everyone will want their own saddle choice and bar/bar-tape. It is almost as if they went to vendors and said we just need to put something on the bike, so give us the cheapest you have regardless of function. For many people what is shipped would have worked if it was of any level of quality and it just adds cost to the overall package having to replace. And it cheapens an otherwise great solution.\nThe not expected: I like the climb feature, particularly on long climbs. However, when riding a Zwift course with a lot of rollers like Sand and Sequoias, it is almost motion sickness inducing. My solution was merely to put the climb lock on when in a section of significant rollers. It might just be me and something I need to get used it.\nA word on financials: Yes $3500 is a lot of money. Yes, it is a luxury. But my backup bike got destroyed and I am not a fan of moving my main bike on and off the trainer as I think it causes undo wear and tear on the bike. If you combine the cost of a decent bike for a trainer, and a decent direct drive smart trainer, and then throw in that you can have multiple users ride it because it is adjustable, I think it made sense for me, even if the experience was equal to a typical direct drive trainer. But the reality is it is a much better experience.",

I was riding within an hour of starting the assembly. \n\nMy previous setup was a power meter-equipped road bike on a dumb trainer, so some of what seems so great about the KICKR bike might be also true of any smart trainer, but the difference to me is night and day.\n\nThe KICKR bike feels like riding on the road in the way momentum carries over when you coast, or cease pedaling just for a few revs, or start up a hill after a descent. On a steep descent it conveys that feeling of carrying a tremendous amount of speed that you get on the road. The way the bike tilts up & down to match grade means your weight distribution is constantly changing on a rolling course, just like on the road.\n\nOver the past year, on any Zwift ride much over an hour, I always watched pro bike racing \nfor the second hour on. I've done several 2+ hour ride on the KICKR bike now, and haven't thought about switching on some racing. It's just way more engaging.\n\nI've got it set up with the same derailleurs and gear ratios as my road bike, and it's amazing how similar the feel is - I've done several outside rides since I've had it. And it's great not to have to take the bike off the trainer, swap wheels, or anything else to be ready to ride outside.\n\nIt's very quiet, quieter than my road bike on the fluid trainer for sure, but not silent. You can hear the turbine/flywheel revving, and there is an audible resonance when you hit a cadence of about 105, at least for the first 15 or 20 minutes of a ride. It isn't displeasing - I actually find it useful as a shifting prompt. After about 20 minutes that resonance stops happening. I haven't found any others like it, at least up to around 140 RPM. \n\nI find myself really looking forward to riding each day, and to doing essentially all base miles on it over the next few months.",

Some of it\u2019s me getting used to the buttons but also the feel (kind of has a dead/lose feel after shifts).\n\nI said nearly silent. It is, although periodically I will feel something rubbing, dragging, or grabbing. It feels like it could be the bottom bracket or drivetrain. I need to investigate it but have not had the time yet.\n\nThe worst part is the seat clamp. The fastener for the clamp is cheap with subpar threads. I had to take it apart and use a wire brush to clean out the threads from the metallic debris and lube the fastener threads to be able to tighten it. I tried tightening the clamp via the hex head, but could not tighten it enough for the seat post not to slip. I finally found (bought) some friction paste for carbon seat posts and put that on the seat post. It used to slip on every ride now it doesn\u2019t. This is known flaw of the Kickr Bike gen I and now gen II. Seems like Wahoo would have fixed it by now, but nope.\n\nI would have given 5 stars, but with the subpar seat post situation and whatever that rubbing feeling is, I think 4 is fair.",

      "content": "I've used a Saris virtual trainer on Zwift with my road bike mounted for a while, but got the KICKR so my wife and I can both use it (I'm 6'3\" and she's 5'1\"). It is a smoother and more realistic experience as far as simulating momentum and power demands over rolling hills with quick gradient changes. The Saris is fine on steady climbs but exaggerates any small change in grade on 'rollers' so you lose momentum and this makes it harder to anticipate gear changes like you'd make on the road in 'sim' mode - which I prefer to 'erg'. The KICKR nails the experience of spinning into a short, steep climb and maintaining speed. Adjusting the bike for our individual fits is pretty easy (I swap pedal positions too) other than the saddle height which could be smoother. It tends to slip even when partially tightened to align the saddle direction. We replaced the included saddle with one that allows better blood flow for men and women. The handle bars are a disappointment - at this price point, I would expect something more comfortable. A flat aero top feels much better when climbing than the quite narrow round tube bars that are included. Overall, I'm very happy with the ride and would give a 'great' rating if the components were closer to what you'd see on a $5K road bike (saddle and bars).",
