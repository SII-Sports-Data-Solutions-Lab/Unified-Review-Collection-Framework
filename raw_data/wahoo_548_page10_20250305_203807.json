      "content": "I will be as detailed as possible here, breaking it down into four categories. 1. Good 2. Bad. 3. Neutral 4. Awesome. I ride a bit on Zwift (solo rides and courses) but mostly like to ride on Fulgaz, Alpine climbs and famous routes.\n\n1. Good - \n * I sweat alot indoors. I been using a Kickr since 2016 and have rusted out chains and front mechs both multiple times. So an encapsulated belt drive system is so very welcome into my life. Just wipe it down like a Spin bike when your done. \n * Bike Profiles - customize a Climbing bike or Hammer. Just pick the profile (from the app) before you ride.\n * Customizable App - lots of options here. Easy to use. (only negative - You have to turn on 'Location' on the BT or it won't find the bike.) \n\n2. Bad - \n * Campagnolo gearing - I am a Campy guy and I went for this option right away. While the shifting is flawless, on steep hills it is TOO easy to bump the Thumb Shifter button and inadvertently change gears. Great on the flats/hills, not so much. \n * Noise - It only happens in like 2 gears in the middle of the virtual cassette. It's a high pitched ringing sound. Like those people who play songs on liquid filled wine glasses...it's a ringing/resonance. It's not metal on metal....just a high toned harmonic vibration. It wouldn't bother me if it was constant (every gear), however it disappears totally once I switch out of those gears. \n\n3. Neutral - \n * 72 tooth gearing - Yes you can set up a gearing for a 72 tooth. However the jumps between virtual cassette rings are so severe that it takes the fun out of it. It's a novelty, but maybe they can improve on the possibilities. \n * Kickr Climb (downhill only) A -15% downhill has you almost falling off the bike (Zwift -coming down from the Radio Tower) It's hard to keep your mojo going on that steep of a decline. It's easy enough to back out of that decline, or even lock out the Climb for the descent. Maybe I just have to get used to it more. \n\nThe AWESOME - \n * It just flows! - No more chains or lube, rocking on the bike. This is a stable, hearty machine. Very natural feeling. \n * Changing lanes on Zwift - one of the 1st kids on the block to have that. There are 5 lanes on Zwift. (Yellow line, 3 normal middle lanes, and the runners lane) You can change lanes one by one or hold the thumb button down and slam across all 5 at once. Ride the inside of every corner. Once every Zwifter has this bike it will look like a drunken mess out there, but for now you can weave in and out of Zwifters and they can't do a thing about it. \n * Kickr Climb - I've never used the Climb before. \nThe original Climb looks wonky to me, it does not look like you can hammer on you bike with that attached to the front fork...never tried it though, so I don't know. BUT THIS - the location is just behind the bottom bracket and is one thick hydraulic piston. IT IS BUTTERY SMOOTH. It feels very natural, quiet yet awesome. One of my complaints with indoor riding is that you can sit down and pedal thru alot of steeps in the virtual world. In reality though, you'd be standing. With the Kickr Climb you HAVE to stand once you get above 8% or so. Very real world feel. I'm quite impressed with the technology. On the side of the bike there is a 'Lock Out' button to stop the Climb, or you can back out of any incline by using the buttons on the tops of the hoods. By why would you....this is why you bought the bike. \n\nOverall - amazing machine. Massive upgrade from the Kickr. Easy to assemble/easy to customize. The Climb is buttery smooth with a stable base you can also crank out the watts on. The Campy thumb shifter could use a little improvement. The humming/harmonic ringing from the flywheel is a little bit of a buzzkill, but hey no more chains and grease, rusted front mechs. Just plug n' play.",

This only took a minute or two, so over all, the app works really well in sorting the fit. \nGears: I wish my road bike had these gears! Never known anything so smooth/ so easy to change, and there's also the option for more technically-minded people to set their own ratios and group sets. Only downside I can see is that when I go back out on the road bike once our winter is over, I'll be wondering why I can't just shift from those dangerous cross-over points. I love the gears. \nThe experience of using the bike actually takes a bit of getting used to, as there is definitely a bit of 'give' when you're pedalling with any great force. This probably makes the Kickr feel more like a 'real' road bike, but it did take me a while to get used to and to accept that it wasn't about to break!\nBuild is seriously good, and good looking. It's certainly raised a few eyebrows when I've proudly shown it off to anyone. I've found that long rides on Zwift are just better/ more comfortable, and that's probably because the pedalling action is so smooth, gearing works so well, and I know there's no risk of my chain accidentally falling off the small ring when I've frantically dropped it down mid-climb. \nIt's still early days, but I'm using the Kickr almost daily, because I miss it if I don't, and that's a good thing.",
