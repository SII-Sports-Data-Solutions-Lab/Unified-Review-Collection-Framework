Using Wahoo System off an iPad to control the bike. \nAs a previous Wahoo trainer owner I expected the bike to be of top quality and I am not disappointed. Set up to fit me was smooth, easy, and quick. \nI chose a fitness program in Wahoo System and liked it had an evaluation program early on so subsequent rides were based on my current condition, I think. The programs have been interesting and I\u2019ve looked forward to each ride. \nHowever, I\u2019ve yet to notice the bike tilt and can\u2019t help wonder if I\u2019ve missed something in the settings. The shifting was a bit confusing and took some digging to find out how it was working. Likewise I spent some time researching if I could use my Garmin 1000 to control the bike as I can with my Wahoo trainer with no clear answer. I think the software assumes I know more about that type of program (or have had previous experience with other indoor bikes and systems) than I do. Sometimes I just want to go for a ride and have yet to find where those programs are.",

I\u2019ve set it up to replicate my outdoor set up and it feels just as comfortable. This is includes the SRAM AXS 12 speed gear configuration which is great.\nHowever that does not mean it is faultless. The seat post and bar post clamps are awful and both slipped badly. The QR bolts are weak and I snapped one trying t get it tight enough. I tried all the fixes recommended but in the end used normal seat post clamps to holds them in the right place. As I don\u2019t share the bike moving them up and down is not an issue. The handlebars feel a bit cheap so I double wrapped them with gel tape which was a great improvement. However on a set up costing \u00a33,000 I would expect better.",

      "content": "Ordered in late November 2019 and received in late Jan 20 - just in time for COVID 19 and work from home life. \n\nIt's the most expensive bike that goes nowhere but can go anywhere virtually. \n\nThe App to set up the bike adjustments gets you close but still requires tweaking. Measurements from actual fitted bikes finished the tweaking to dial in the adjustment setting. I did this for 2 bikes. The handle bar would go out of setting on those hard up hill charges. I eventually found a setting that works for both of us and I tightened it down pretty good. It doesn't move on the hard charges now. \n\nThe attitude changes on the Zwift hills is a great feature and makes it more \"real\". I have a computer running Zwift and a 27 in monitor at the right height for viewing (KICKR Stand works great for this setup). Overall, it's a great riding experience compared to other trainers. The one thing that took some adjusting was that you never stop pedaling when riding on Zwift. Nothing slows you down so you just keep going like the energizer bunny.\n\nMy wife \"allowed\" the purchase because I was completing my \"Gap Year\" between retirement and a job that found me. She felt it would provide a better opportunity for me to ride during the Michigan winter because of the new job hours. Keep in mind that I have been riding outside year round for many years but the thought of not having to gear up for 15 minutes prior to riding in the dark at 15 degrees had an appeal so I didn't offer much resistance. \n\nI started riding and showed my wife the adjustments and Zwift and got her to try it. Guess who rides it more that I do? She was always a fair weather rider (limited to above freezing temps) and likes the variety of rides that Zwift provides. She also listens to podcasts during her ride because the bike is so quiet. Shifting is quick and easy and almost feels like the Dura Ace Di2 on my Trek Domane 6.0 The virtual 11-30 11 speed cassette makes the hills an easier climb but she doesn't have to know I made that adjustment to our road bike (wink).\n\nWe are both happy with the purchase even if I was a little alarmed at the 004 serial number. We have had no issues with 2K miles and are now level 20 on Zwift. I would recommend this bike to those who love to ride, can afford it and Zwint, and have the space. You will use it year round especially on those rainy days when the ride outside is possible but it's nicer inside.\n\nWhen you do get outside, the riding will be a lot easier than Zwift. But the head on a swivel and alertness gets older quickly after mindlessly powering the Zwift riding.",

I was a bit skeptical with the design when I saw the pictures, but the actual product looks much better than the pictures in my opinion. \n\nI see some advantages (and some disadvantages) when compared to a trainer + bike. \nAdvantages:\n1) the visual appearance, which can be important depending on where you keep your trainer\n2) the easy of adjusting the settings, it makes much easier to share the trainer with another user (without having to swap bikes all the time)\n3) it's always ready to use (you can achieve this having a bike permanently on the trainer, but it will cost you as much as the Kickr Bike)\n\nDisadvantages:\n1) It's no so easy to move it around, if you need to take it out of the way in some occasions. It is probably super difficult if you have to move houses!\n2) It does not have a TT/Tri bike setup (but probably extensions bars can be attached to the handlebars)",

      "content": "Upgraded from a Wahoo Kickr smart trainer, so I'm a fan of their product line. This smart bike is an incredible product \u2013 very satisfied. Also, I use exclusively with Zwift.\nThe Wahoo setup app was very helpful. Used by comparing with my actual Trek road bike to obtain the settings & establish a bike profile based on actual gearing, shifters & crank arm lengths. Easily added Look pedals to match my preference on my Trek. Smart bike settings can be easily tweaked-from seat-post to head-set. Very adjustable & versatile for a smart bike. Impressed.\nVirtual shifters are amazingly quick. I did not use the incline simulation with previous smart trainer, but was pleasantly surprised with that feature on this bike. Bike seat can also be replaced! And it's noticeably quiet compared to the KICKR Smart Trainer I was previously using. My family has specifically mentioned this as I ride in the early AM hours while watching PL football on NBCSN \u2013 bike, and thus TV, are not disruptive in the household! \nNegatives: Only 1 cage for bottles. But a greater issue for me was that longer water bottles, such as Camelbak Podium Big Chill, don't easily fit with shift cables hooked to the LED Display. Plus, I don't prefer where the LED Display is mounted.",
