      "content": "Really happy with the purchase. Has changed indoor riding workouts for me and am choosing to ride indoors with the KICKR Bike and Zwift over the outdoors even on nice days. For context, my previous setup was a KICKR smart trainer and KICKR climb. Positives: ultra smooth ride, realistic gear changing, grade simulation that transitions so smoothly that it feels natural, realistic bike setup. Areas to improve: saddle, hoods, and handlebar tape. Be prepared to change out your saddle and put on some cushier, higher quality bar tape. Definitely not a deal breaker, but the saddle and bar tape that come with the bike are cheap. Biggest beef: that the hoods get slippery when I\u2019m sweaty. Wish they would have texturized the hoods and used a different compound that gets tackier with sweat. A slight annoyance but everything else about this bike is a game-changer for my indoor workouts!",

Gear changes are instantaneous and if you stand up for extra power, the trainer is totally stable. Bikes attached to normal trainers can be wobbly when you stand up and ride hard. The Kickr Bike feature that rises and falls with the terrain incline is quite cool and adds to the overall enjoyment. Connecting to my Apple TV was a breeze. I highly recommend the Kickr Bike!",

It\u2019s s an absolute blast to ride and makes Zwifting even better.\n\nMy only complaint would be the shipping. It is terrible. It took 12 days to get by bike after paying for premium shipping. It came from Macon, GA. I live in Rome, GA\u2026that is basically a 3 hour drive. It was scheduled to be delivered and I took the day off of work to be at home. No one called me and no bike showed up. I had to contact the shipping company myself to follow up on my scheduled appointment. Of course they said the driver had to reschedule and had called me and left a voicemail. Come on, this day and time it\u2019s impossible to miss a call without intentionally ignoring it. I have a cell phone and smart watch on me 24/7. I sat at home all day staring out the window like a 5 year old waiting for Christmas Day. There is no way I\u2019m missing a call. Obviously, there were no missed calls and no voicemails from the \u201cdriver\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t have even been that upset with it not being delivered if not for the company making ridiculous claims about calling and not getting me and leaving me voicemails\u2026please. Maybe something like the truck got a flat tire would have been a better excuse, or even better, an actual phone call stating, sorry we will need to reschedule. When people are rearranging their days to accept delivery and using their own PTO time, there should be some level of respect from the other party.\n\nObviously, the shipping has nothing to do with the actual Kickr bike which is better than I imagined. It was easy to assemble. I used the fit wizard to set it up which was not perfect but it did get me close and I just tweaked from there. I would highly recommend the Kickr bike. However, I do feel that Wahoo should contract with a different delivery service. Honestly, it was terrible. I would have loved an option to pick it up directly. I would gladly driven to Macon to pick it up, saved the $150, and gotten it 10 or 11 days sooner.",

      "content": "Just received the KICKR Bike a few days ago. For me it was exceptionally easy to assemble. Sizing adjustments are easy to make as well. Construction seems very solid. The operation is smooth and quiet. I haven't put in a lot of miles yet so all of the functionality has yet to be tested but it's great so far. The bike itself is fantastic. The only issue I've had is with the Smart Fit Wizard in the Wahoo app. It doesn't seem to want to accurately translate the professional fit numbers I type in. I'm of average height (5' 9\") and it told me I needed to put the seat height to 18 or get an extension post. At that height I can't even touch the pedals. Other measurements (stack, reach, etc.) were similarly incorrect. I actually had to use a tape measure and make all the adjustments manually, then save them in my profile. Even called Wahoo support. \n They were unable to solve the problem. Not sure what the issue is with the app but aside from that one thing, I am completely satisfied with the bike. On a side note, the staff at Wahoo Support were incredibly nice and accommodating (top notch).",
