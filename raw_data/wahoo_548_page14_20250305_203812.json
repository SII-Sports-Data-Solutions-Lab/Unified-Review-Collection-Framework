No information from the company, even when the bike shipped. I opened multiple support tickets to get some sort of status after a few weeks with no communication from the company. It wasn't until I sent a terse email that I was provided with a tracking number, shipping company, phone number and dates.. not sure why that cant be provided automatically through email or website rather than thinking my bike is sitting in the ether where nobody knows what happened to it. Once I had this information, I had to do all the investigative work to reach out and get it delivered.. all of the information that the delivery company had was wrong (5 digit phone number??, wrong address??) It's all input correctly into the order and account on the website, so someone is manually typing into an ordering portal somewhere.\n\nFrustrating that I had to unwind this mess myself, Wahoo just kept telling me to wait a few more weeks.. it would have never showed up because all of the information the shipping company had was wrong.\n\nOn niche products, customer support is usually a priority, not for this company apparently.",

After foolish troubleshooting, I was shipping a new handlebar assembly, 2nd day Air FedEx, on the 27th; it arrived at the FedEx shipping point in Kennesaw, GA, on the 29th. That means it took 2 days to get 50 miles. No, at the time of review, I have not used the bike because it is not operational still.

The people I corresponded were cordial and knowledgeable. The problem is that it took over a week, Oct 31 to Nov 11 to get a replacement bike on the way. This problem could have been handled in a few minutes with a phone call but Wahoo insists on email communication which absolutely sucks. Email and wait for a response, repeat for days.

      "content": "This is my third dedicated indoor spin bike and by FAR my most expensive (and disappointing). This is my first \"smart bike\" and the reason why I \"upgraded\" from my other spin bikes. My prior spin bike is a Cycleops 300 Pro and I purchased the Wahoo because I wanted to be able to fully integrate with Zwift, Sufferfest, and Rouvy. The overall smart features re: integrating and pairing with these third party apps has worked as expected and pairing is easy. This is the only upgrade over my other spin bikes that were 1 quarter of the cost. The overall comfort of the bike has been disappointing, having to change out the saddle, handlebars and stem to get a comfortable fit (even using the special features on the Wahoo app was not helpful and I found it weird that I couldn't replicate a comfortable fit that the cheaper bikes had). The bike is not \"virtually silent\", but not incredibly loud either. It's about as loud as a microwave, but beware of the high pitched squeels that you will get at different cadences and speeds. Also disappointing that there's nowhere to put a tablet or phone, or anything for that matter (so you will need to spend even more money if you want to have a place to put your tablet, phone, towel, etc). There is 1 USB charging port but again, what's the point when there's nowhere to put whatever you are charging. Lastly, there seems to be a learning curve to dialing in the shifting as well. The actual \"feel\" of the shift on the levers is realistic, but don't expect to be able to hold a consistent power or cadence during shifting, like on an outdoor bike. Stability is also lacking, meaning I probably won't tip the bike over, but it sure feels like it when standing or sprint (keep in mind that I'm a 5'6 female who hardly generates loads of power). And lastly, the \"thigh rub\" issue that others have mentioned, meaning my thighs rub on the frame when riding. I am really wanting to like this bike but am currently finding it impossible to justify the cost of the upgrade over my other spin bikes (which were better in every way but would not fully integrate into the Sufferfest).",

Each successive shift results in huge spikes in power, followed by a lot of ~5-10% undulations in power until it finally settles in after about 30 seconds.
