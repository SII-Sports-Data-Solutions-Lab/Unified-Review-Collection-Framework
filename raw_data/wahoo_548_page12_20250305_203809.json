I like not having to worry about tire pressure or spinning out when applying sudden power (as with my wheel-on trainer). It shines when I'm applying more power, such as when doing sprints in Zwift. For this, it is so much sturdier than my old setup. I'm hoping this will last for years but it's complexity makes me a bit worried about that prospect. I haven't been able to find a way to use resistance mode with Trainerroad yet which is disappointing as I expected that I would have this option.",

Since I have been riding on it, I do enjoy my Zwift rides more than I had in the past using Kickr (2019 model) on my Aethos (Specialized) bike. A few features I appreciate are: In you're setup, you can select from multiple group sets based on your riding experience, including the cassette and crank lengths. The bike can be set up for multiple profiles pretty easily. The Wahoo app has the ability to create a fit based on your road bike for the best comfort; although it was a miss for me, I performed my own fit. I also appreciate the auto (or manual) tilt for grade percentages and the ability to steer into corners. A big plus is it is much quieter than the Kickr models, and I don't have to perform a calibration. \"For me\" I would pay a bit more for better handlebars. I was able to purchase this on a Black Friday sale at almost half the regular price; therefore, this has been a great purchase. If I did not dislike virtual rides so much this could be a 5-star.",

A couple of things held me back from a 5 star. The head tube and seat tube did not have the friction paste applied like the new one did. The power supply that shipped with the unit was defective so Wahoo did not test the bike with the shipped power supply. I believe Wahoo should be a little better with these reconditioned devices before shipping",

The build compared to the Garmin Tacx bike, which I also have in my research lab, is less solid feeling initially, with lower quality handle bars. However, according to our research subjects, when riding, it is more forgiving on 60-120 minute rides according to our research subjects. The change in grade when going negative feels very unnatural compared to the road, especially when it is below -2% grade. The inclines feel more natural. Responsiveness in erg mode feels smooth with all the programs we use in our lab. It would be nice to have a full aero bar set-up option that could be quickly changed. In our laboratory, we work with both road cyclists and triathletes on most days. Finally, the rider position adjustments are much more precise than our Tacx bike.",

Takes up less room than a turbo trainer + bike combo, and means you can keep your bike ready for outdoor rides, if you do those.\n\nRelatively easy to set up. I had a bike fit but unfortunately not one supported by Wahoo app, so went down the route of taking a picture of my outdoor bike to get approximate settings, which I have now tweaked.\n\nOnce set up, connects to Zwift very easily and quickly every time. Fairly quiet in usage apart from a high-pitched whistle from the fly wheel, but still quieter than a bike chain on a turbo trainer, and easily ignored when listening to music.\n\nI love the grade simulation - actually physically angling the bike up or down as well as the resistance, according to what's happening in Zwift. A bit annoying that I have to remember to 'unlock' the grade simulation every time I log in to Zwift, however. Wish it wouldn't keep resetting.\n\nOnly thing I would like on this bike is the road feel that I used to get from my Tacx Neo. I'm surprised at how much I miss the feel of riding over cobbles or gravel in Zwift \u2013 I now realise how much of a physical cue that was to me putting in more effort to keep my speed up as well as making Zwift more immersive.",

I enjoy riding it and setting new times and increasing my power outputs. I like how you can match it up with the WahooFit App to see all the numbers. \nThe only issue I have is that I wish Wahoo would have mentioned that smaller riders may have a fitment issue. And the KICKR bike may not be the right KICKR product. I bought the KICKR bike mainly for my wife, but I feel it's slightly too big, and she can't get the best benefits from it.

After a quick conversation with Wahoos customer service they had two new ones sent to me. As Tom Petty sang, the waiting is the hardest part. \n\nSince getting the Kickr Bike I have fallen in love with it. It rides amazing. Really lets you dial in your fit. Erg mode is so fast to kick in. Both TR and Zwift function perfectly. I love using this so much more than my own bike on a Kickr. I am so happy I pulled the trigger to order this.",

There are cheap aftermarket alternatives that do a far better job of preventing seat and handle bar slippage. If there are better aftermarket products then it'd hard to understand why or how Wahoo continues with the current solution.\n\nThe quality of the build was poor. Some of the screws holding the plastic covers in place were loose an none of them had been tightened to a specific torque. The result was awful rattles at various flywheel speeds. This again is easily fixed by ensuring the build team work to an OP and the QA team test the OP has been adhered to.\n\nI'm fortunate that I am able to assess engineering faults and easily remedy them. Many others are not and these simple issues will result in a very poor experience. \n\nI logged a fault call for the above and was immediately offered a replacement bike. Many folk applaud this as an exemplary service. However I do not agree. Bike swap outs cost money and are a nuisance that should only be used as a last resort. \nThe cost ultimately has to be covered by the purchase price. So the rather lazy practice of just reaching straight for a swap out is costing all of us money.\n\nPlease take the above points as constructive critic that would, in my opinion, move a great product to an outstanding product.",
