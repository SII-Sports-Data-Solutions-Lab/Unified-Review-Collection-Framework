      "content": "Pros: the build set up is very quick, a couple of bolts through the support legs and figure out your bike fit from your current road bike. Then plug it in. I have mine set up on a mat on carpet and it\u2019s very stable. I weigh 150lbs 5\u201911\u201d. There is no spin down or calibration needed so that was fantastic compared to the KICKR. The bike fit adjustments are simple and straightforward with measurement markers to remember your fit if anyone else wants to ride. Once riding, the ride is very smooth. The ERG mode in workouts is amazing. Power change is rapid and holds the power steady within 1-2 watts always. It sounds a bit like an electric vehicle, almost silent. Big difference from the chain grinding days with the KICKR. This bike works wonderfully with all Wahoo apps and products. I will admit, I don\u2019t use Zwift as I\u2019m training for CX and XC racing and Zwift is too glitchy as a 3rd party app. I replaced the seat with my own so I can\u2019t comment on the comfort level there. \n\nCons: there aren\u2019t many really. My biggest, and it\u2019s mostly a personal preference, is the cockpit/handlebars. I prefer a thicker bar that is a little larger. There are also so many different areas that can be gear shifters that I find myself accidentally pushing these buttons while riding. I haven\u2019t figured out how to lock some of them out so that it\u2019s just shifting with the brakes below the hoods which is what I prefer from my Di2 shifting. It also doesn\u2019t ride as smooth in low cadence/high power drills. It gets a little bumpy but that\u2019s at a cadence of 50-60 which I don\u2019t do much. \n\nOverall very happy with the purchase and would do it again for the flawless shifting and silent ride quality. Great job Wahoo.",

I\u2019m around 200 pounds and it provides a great platform to put down watts. The ride feel on Zwift is very realistic, I just wish that elevation was integrated more into Systm workouts. I have two complaints. The seat post is very hard to get to stay in place (seat post paste is a necessity), and the handle bars will not stay perfectly centered. They turn ever so slightly when I clamp them in place. You may not notice it since it is slight, but it does happen. Overall, I highly recommend the bike if you can deal with the price.",

      "content": "Full disclosure, I have never had a smart trainer although I've had a dumb trainer. For the last few years, I have used a very cheap spin bike with power meter pedals to Zwift and ride. So, relatively, the Kickr Bike is a dream ride. \n\nWahoo's installation and configuration guidance were amazing although I struggled a little to get the bike configured. I used the Wahoo app's ability to take a picture of my road bike in order to get my measurements, which at first wasn't working likely due to an unknown user error but eventually, I figured it out and the measurements felt correct. I did struggle and frankly perhaps am still struggling to understand if I've mapped the right settings to the Kickr bike that mimic my road bike. The shifting when I'm riding the Kickr doesn't seem to be the same shifting as when I'm riding my road bike. I wish this were easier to understand with a feature to perhaps select my bike/component from a dropdown list to ensure it matches expectations. \n\nI thought that it's a little weird to unplug the bike when turning it off but okay. When beginning a ride, the bike will make noise but quiets down to a small whir after a few moments of getting going. \n\nI struggled at first to understand the modes (i.e., ERG vs Level) and what symbols on the bike's display meant (closed lock versus open lock). Now it's easy to remember. The point is that there was some learning curve to understand the features from the perspective of someone using a new smart trainer/bike for the first time. \n\nThe cost is steep but the Kickr bike keeps me going and definitely feels more like a bike than my last setup. Time will tell how I really feel but after a few weeks, I am loving it.",

The Kickr turbo trainer was great but the Kickr Bike is solid, well built and so responsive. I have only had it for two weeks now but I have used it everyday and upped my train considerably. I use it with Zwift and have beaten all my times on every course and increased my FTP. \nI l;ove this bike which is a joy to ride :-)",
