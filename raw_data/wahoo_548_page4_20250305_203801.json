      "content": "The good: overall this is a 5 star product, the design team did a great job on it, it has the most and the best features available today, it is very adjustable, it looks great and doesnt take up too much space and it gives you an excellent workout. I compared the simulation on Zwift to real life and, the way this bike handles changes in terrain and adjusts the load is outstanding, to the point that I had the same level of tiredness over the same distance on a flat course as I do in real life, even the speeds generally matched what I get in real life data. Having said this, the downhill simulation is the only place its not perfect in that regard, it doesnt quite feel right, the flywheel doesnt seem to keep up with the simulation and, if you were rolling down a steep hill and stopped pedaling the system will spin down and the flywheel will eventually fully stop, even though in Zwift you are still rolling down and picking up speed. It doesnt seem to allow you to freewheel downhill properly. Im guessing that, if the motor is strong enough this can be fixed with software patches. Overall this is an outstanding exercise tool and worth the money hands down. I cant speak for long term reliability but, it feels like it should handle the virtual miles well. \n\nThe bad: the seat that comes with the bike is terrible, dont even try to use it it will hurt you, just have a different seat right away and install it from the start. My particular bike had a lot of vibration and metallic buzzing at low rpm, at first I thought something inside was loose but, that was not the case. On the left side of the bike (left when sitting on it) is a plastic panel attached with a bunch of little Allen head screws, if you remove that panel you get access to the rear axle adjustment bolt (9/16th wrench), a circuit board and the cooling system. Now, the way they cool part of the system is by having a fan blowing through a metal wind tunnel, inside that wind tunnel are two metal coils/springs, the problem is that when certain vibrations hit those coils, they make a metallic buzzing sound like a screw rattling. The vibrations themselves came from the flywheel, it is a heavy flywheel and the rear axle adjuster is the oldschool \"slider\" type, you loosen the bolt and slide that side of the axle around a little bit changing the angle of the flywheel relative to the center line of the bike. Well, in my bike it wasnt adjusted correctly, the flywheel was slightly off center causing a lot of vibration, especially at low RPM, and those vibrations caused everything that could buzz to do so, after playing around with it I was able to center the flywheel a lot better and the vibration is now gone for the most part. So, if you get this bike and experience something like this thats how you fix it, the company doesnt have instructions yet so I wrote them for you here.",

Bought the kicker bike, head fan, and stand to recover and rebuild my health from surgery. I just started exercising on it and so happy in the investment. I adjusted the bike in a very upright position for now. And will gradually adjust more aggressively as I improve until it matches my road bike. That is awesome about the kicker bike. Train indoors all through the winter and early spring to be ready for next summer outdoors! Its quite and smooth. I'm excited for the journey ahead to become myself once again.",
