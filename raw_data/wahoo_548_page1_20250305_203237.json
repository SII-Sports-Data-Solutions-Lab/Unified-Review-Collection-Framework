      "content": "The Kickr bike is a well engineered bike simulator. It was easy to set up and get going with Zwift workouts. Super stable and capable. Riding experience is smooth and I like the full integration with Zwift. I\u2019m 70 years old and my preferred fit puts the top of the handlebar pretty level with the top of the saddle. To match my set up of the size 54 Specialized Diverge, I had to swap out the Kickr stem with a shorter one with a steeper angle. This could also be achieved with the stock stem by running the bike at a 3% or so incline. But using the incline to get the dimensions is incompatible with Zwift controlling the incline. My recommendation would be for wahoo to add the ability to move the zero incline setting via the software thus expanding the range of set up dimensions. An adjustable zero point for incline. Maybe this is available but I didn\u2019t see it anywhere in the app. \n\nI am very happy with my purchase and would absolutely recommend this machine as a \u201cclose to real as possible\u201d trainer.",

Maybe my expectation were too high. Shifting feel is unnatural because of a braking effect when up-shifting. One must overcome this and it's very different than upshifting on a real bike. Though I can set the gear ratios to match my real bike, the feel is completely different and thus makes that feature of limited use. But by changing the gear ratio, I can mimic the feel I expect on a particular gradient (some of this will be app-dependent). Purchasing the bike is just the start of a large investment in apps, fans, electronic connections and accessories, so for those on a budget (like me), just be ware of this.\nThings I like. Despite the lack or realism I expected, the overall experience of using the bike with an app that takes me to new places virtually, and that mimics gradients well, allows me to enjoy indoor cycling. I can train more days each week, and do so on days when I cannot or don't want to ride outside. Though some say that the gradient changing ability of the bike is over-rated, I quite like it. Also, I even like the stock seat that comes with the bike. I've had a few interactions with customer service about their app, and always received prompt and courteous replies. Finally, after riding this bike a couple of weeks, I noticed that my outdoor riding did improve. So the correlation works in that respect. I'm still new to the bike and haven't tapped its full potential, so these are just first impressions.",

I was considering doing a validation exercise with my power pedals, but then the bike never switched on again.\n\nThe staff at Wahoo are super helpful and arranged a new bike to be sent to me. Unfortunately, the couriers were rubbish, appeared unable to answer my questions in my emails and it took nearly a week to arrive after Wahoo had despatched. It was meant to come on the Monday, then Wednesday and eventually the Friday. This was a pain because I was arranging my work schedule round it.\n\nOf course, Wahoo don\u2019t want poor reviews and my guess is returns are costly (& presumably costed in to the high cost of the bike). But I would hope that being a bit more robust in quality assurance after refurbishment would be better.\n\nIn the end I\u2019m happy, but it took a bit of time to get there.",
