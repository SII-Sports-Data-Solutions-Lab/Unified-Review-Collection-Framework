When it died, I didn't think I should spend a lot replacing it, so I got another smart trainer. It was fine.\n\nWhen V2 came out, I was curious about deals on V1 Bikes, and am so glad I looked into it. I've had the KICKR Bike setup for just over a week now, and it's really so much better than I imagined. I love this thing.\n\nSo smooth, responsive and quiet. Even my 'silent' trainer is multiples louder. I've read some comments about thigh rub due to the width of the unit, but I have had no issue (and I don't have skinny legs).\n\nWorks beautifully with Zwift (which I'm also new to). I had a Tacx trainer and used their app, which won't work with the KICKR Bike, which is such a shame. Riding real, outdoor rides is so nice (plus I have a wasted subscription now). I'll have to check out Wahoo SYSTM to get back to that. I used to train with Sufferfest, so it should be easy to get back into. Zwift is neat, but I do like seeing real, actual worlds if I'm stuck indoors.\n\nBut the KICKR Bike...only issue is that I waited so long to get it. It's really fantastic.",

It is on a whole other level of trainer.\nEverything has been super simple to set up and use, and I'm now learning about the Systm triathlon plans as a potential alternative to my existing training structure.\n\nIn short, love the bike! Assuming it doesn't fail in the next 12 months, this is a 5/5 purchase (saddle is a 1/5, but I speculate anyone buying this already has a strong opinion on saddles and will replace the stock one).",

My reason for purchasing that model was the price point as an entry to in home bike trainers until I could gauge my commitment. 2 years later, I decided to upgrade to the KICKR Bike and I couldn't be happier. In fact, I am more consistent with riding due to the fact that I no longer have to attach/detach my outdoor bike, it's leagues quieter, no calibration necessary, no checking air pressure, I can turn, automatic incline/decline, and smaller foot print. I would absolutely recommend for anyone who already knows they enjoy cycling. You will not regret it!!!",

Interestingly, the more I ride it the less I think\nabout the idea of a trainer bike since it has the feel and response of my road machines. As such, I can focus of whatever training program I am doing and know that the ride experience and performance it delivers is there without obsessing over what is producing that experience.\nI use Di2 on all my bikes and the KICR Bike is very realistic to an outdoor ride. The grade change feature has required little adaptation and is a great feature.\nWell done Wahoo!!",

I setup the bike using the numbers from a Retul bike fit on my road bike, and with a few tweaks, it was perfect. I swapped out the bars for a more ergonomic style and with thicker bar tape which improved the comfort. I love that you can program the gears and shifting with the Wahoo app. Now that shifting is much easier, I increased the Zwift trainer difficulty above 50% to capture more of the incline/decline on the Kickr Bike. OVer all this is a significant step up from the Wahoo Kickr v2 I was using before. I also appreciate the increased accuracy and the fact that the Bike is auto calibrated.",
