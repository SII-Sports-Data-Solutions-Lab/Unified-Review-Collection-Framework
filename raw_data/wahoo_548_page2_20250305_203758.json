As it is not an outdoor bike, some ratchet mechanism for would have been achievable and appreciated.\nThe position of the steering buttons is also not the best, as it can be pressed without intention very easily. Also it worked straight away on Zwift but now for some unknown reason it\u2019s no longer working.\nBut the major drawback in my opinion is that I\u2019ve noticed a quite important lag in the bike adjustment when connected to Zwift of about 5 seconds (maybe more). For that reasons I\u2019ve downgraded the mark by 1 star.\nBut overall, the pedaling feeling is so smooth that it\u2019s still worth the change from my previous Kickr Core.\nHope this review will be found helpful to all.",

There is one single issue during the rides...after some minutes in some situations there is a cracking sound from the height of the crank. I could not figure out, where it comes from but for a product in this price range that shouldn't be.\n\nThe bike stands very stable (my weight is 85 kg) and is well build. I have fun go ride it!",

      "content": "Think hard about whether to buy this. Overall I\u2019m glad I did but only because I got it at the \u00a32199 price. Full price and I\u2019d be \u2018no way\u2019 because there are just too many defects. \n\nAssembly is simple, set up and connection to Zwift is also easy. The problems for me came when I started fitting it and then sitting on it.\n\nThe fit via the app is a very good starting point but it needs refining. It suggested for me (I\u2019m 182cm) a saddle height of over 15 on the seatpost. Ok, but the post only goes up to 14. I contacted Wahoo and after supplying details of my fit to check what I was saying was true they told me I needed a larger seatpost which they then sent out to me a few days later. That to me is bonkers. I\u2019m not a giant: why not just include a larger seatpost as standard?\n\nAs it happens that was not the only thing they had to send me over the first week or two: I\u2019ve now been sent three quick release levers and an Allen bolt fixing \u2014 all to try and fasten the seatpost and the handlebars. They keep slipping. This is a well documented problem: it\u2019s a design fault and the fittings are shoddy. You spend a lot of time emailing wahoo support (which is very responsive) trying to implement what are clearly hacks and workarounds. Their latest is to suggest buying some carbon grip paste. Wow. \n\nOne of the reasons I bought this was so we could easily adjust the fit settings for both my wife and I. There is no way she can open the QR clamps given the force you need to open and close them. \n\nSo why have I kept it? Because once you get past all this, it is (so far) a great great improvement for me on the smart trainer setup I had before (old entry Tiagra set up bike on an Elite Suito). It takes up less space, the feel is way better; weirdly the pedalling feels smoother as well. The tilt function is great and just adds a little variability to alleviate turbo boredom. \n\nPeople moan about the gear LED display but it\u2019s not a huge issue. But the gears themselves take some mental adjustment and I think this is partly a result of Wahoo setting expectations too high by claiming you can set them up to relocate your outdoor bike. While you can choose whatever group set you like, be warned: those gears do not feel like you\u2019re riding outdoors. The shift from top few sprockets on the cassette into the bigger gears is really noticeable. Whereas before for sprints I may well have shifted into the 13 or 12 sprocket straight away and stayed there, on this and for whatever set up I choose I never move into the smaller sprockets on the Kickr. I hit the same power as before but it feels harder work. You just have to adjust. Wahoo has provided some explanation around gravity and perception for this change versus outdoors and I get that: but why market it so much that the gearing is a replica of outdoors if they know it\u2019s not really?\n\nAnyway you get used to it. \n\nI\u2019m two weeks in and I think 4 stars is about right, perhaps 3.5.",

I started with a Kickr core 2 years ago, upgraded to a 2018 Kickr 1 year ago for a more stable and accurate sprinting platform, and made the transition to the Kickr Bike last month. Real bike feel is paramount to me. I average 175km indoors and 200km outdoors weekly, the Kickr bike has made the fitting process and adaptability a breeze. No more fiddling with chains and cassettes, no more NOISE, and no more lengthy sweat cleanup sessions. It is sleek, elegant, capable, dynamic, and customizable. I was hesitant to make this investment in a trainer, but so far it has been a joy to have everything WORK and SYNC every time, right away. I verify the wattage through my Assiamo Duo power pedals, and the readings have consistently proven within 1.5%. \nIf you train indoors regularly, you should not hesitate to invest in the best; you do outdoors, it only makes sense to do so indoors as well. Looking forward to putting it through it\u2019s paces this ZRL and testing that upper wattage threshold. \n\nHappy camper. Suffering well. ;)",
