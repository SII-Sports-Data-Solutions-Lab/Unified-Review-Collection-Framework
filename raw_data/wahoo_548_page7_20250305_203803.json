      "content": "I was reluctant to purchase a Kickr bike for the longest time because I had heard of issues when it first came out. When I saw it go on sale in the summer I had a feeling that a new version was about to be announced. It was! But it was also $500 more. I hesitated but finally succumb to buying it. I ride on Zwift several thousand miles a year and maybe all the issues were resolved. Well, it is a GREAT bike. I have it connected by ethernet to my network and it just works. The bike is very smooth and while it took me at least 4 rides to get my position correct after that I love to get on it. It is solid as a rock and I can change the gearing to whatever I want it to be. My only gripe was that I had to re-wrap the bars with better tape.",

The bottom line isvthat I have a lot of experience with Wahoo haven ridden over 50K kilometers on the platforms. \n\nWhen the Kickr Bike was introduced I was a little skeptical. A lot of money for the same thing I do on my bike. I held off buying one. Last month I decided to go for it. I'm totally impressed. Ultra sturdy, well engineered and a marvel of design. Adjustable in every way down to a fraction of a millimeter. Clean operation with no chain oil or debris created by cassette and chain wear. Well thought out in every way. I live in a location with real, very long winters and without my indoor setup I'd go crazy. I'm very satisfied and as I use it more I'll update my review.",
