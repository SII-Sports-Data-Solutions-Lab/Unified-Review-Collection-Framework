I contacted Wahoo Support, and they said this high-pitched ringing sound is an \u201cinherent\u201d noise of the motor and is \u201cnormal for the KICKR Bike,\u201d but that they would be happy to provide a \u201ccourtesy\u201d replacement. They also told me to be aware the replacement will have the same motor sound I\u2019ve been experiencing. Well, I decided to take that chance and asked for the courtesy replacement. The second bike arrived without a problem, but the bike was FILTHY and looked more like a used item than a reconditioned one (see photos). It appeared that NO effort was made to recondition this second bike, and I contacted Wahoo Support right away. Now I\u2019m waiting and waiting and waiting to hear back. In the meantime, I have no training bike and am very unhappy. I am a long-time Wahoo customer, too, because I like the other products. I own a Wahoo bike computer, heart rate monitor, speed and cadence sensors, and have owned 2 Kickr Cores.

      "content": "I'm so disappointed and frustrated with this product and especially the customer service. 1st the shipping issue where it took forever and I never knew where my bike was and no one could tell me. When I finally received it nothing worked. The fit app didn't work or any of the fitting tools. I had to do everything manually on my own.I watched many videos, use to work as a bike mechanic and fitter as a side job in a bike shop. I watched many videos about this bike and the fact that you are supposed to be able to replace the handlebars with your own because yours are terrible. This didn't work because there was something wrong with the shifters. They must have been cemented on and would not come off. The design of the shifters where the Allen key is makes it impossible to get the shifters off and the bolts stripped and one shifter broke. So far nothing about this bike worked and all the reasons I bought it failed. So I get in touch with customer service again which is really useless because they take so long to get back to you, always at least 24-48 hours and nothing on the weekends and since I received the bike on Friday I couldn't talk to anyone. When I finally got in touch with someone I requested new shifters and was willing to pay for expedited shipping. 1st they told me they couldn't send just shifters and had to send handlebars. Back to square one. Almost an entire week goes by and no handlebars. I contact customer service again and lose 2 more days waiting to find out the bars were left at the warehouse and never shipped. So customer service now tells me they will expedite shipping. Gee thanks. I ordered this bike on 12/23/21 and it is now 1/18/ 22 and I still can't use it and have no idea if I will ever be able to. I'll probably have to take the bars to a shop so someone else can try to get the shifters off for me since customer service said they couldn't send just shifters. This has been such a frustrating long drawn out experience with a product that still doesn't do anything it supposed to and doesn't do anything I purchased it for.I still don't know when I'll receive the bars or if I'll be able to get the shifters off and onto my bars to work. I don't understand why they can't send me just shifters before the cement them on and make it impossible to get off. All this is so unacceptable and especially after paying $150 for your so called premium shipping where it took forever to receive the bike and then most of the reasons I purchased this bike over others don't work. My level of disappointment and frustration is unexplainable and I'm still out in the dark alone because customer service is almost useless except of course when I was doing my research and spoke to a real person about all my questions and she told me all these things were not an issue and I could do all the things I asked about. At this point I really don't know what to do or should do especially since I don't know when I will get the bars, if they will work or if the fit will be okay. At this point I would have sent it back if it wasn't so difficult to repack.",

I called Motion Makers to make sure that the trainer is NOT in the US They said it is not in the the US So I ordered Another reconditioned trainer from Wahoo. Now I'm over $7000 on my credit card. Now I just want delivery of the the bike.The day I ordered a reconditioned trainer they sent me an Email that the bike is available and ready for delivery.After 5 months now I'm waiting to get my credit card reimbursed.",

I immediately had a bad feeling but hoped that when it was setup and plugged in the rubbing would be resolved. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The rubbing was still there. \nThis is extremely poor quality control. At a minimum the flywheel should be turned before the bike goes into the box at the factory.\nMy support ticket is in with Wahoo so we will see what the fix is. I'm really not looking forward to lugging the unit up from the basement, packing it up, driving it to the shipping location, and carrying it into the counter. The unit weighs nearly 100 lbs and the box is bulky. Its not like boxing up a trainer, It's more like figuring out how to ship a spin bike. \n\nWhile I am extremely annoyed and frustrated after spending nearly $4,000 after tax, this is an opportunity for customer support to shine.\nI will update my review once my issue gets resolved.",
