      "content": "One week of use and these are my thoughts:\n-Delivery and setup were quick and easy. \n-Use of the app to make initial adjustments produced a fit that was in the ballpark. After a few rides I've got it dialed in.\n-Saddle was tossed after the first ride. Replaced with one I had that works perfectly. \n-I'm replacing the bars with a set that suits my riding style and comfort. The bars that came with the bike were really low quality given the expense of the bike.\n-Saddle height and handlebar height settings are very adjustable, but require A LOT of clamping force to keep the both from sliding back into the frame. Particular to the handlebar, the clamp force rotates the bars slightly causing the bike to feel crooked. Stem had to be loosened and rotated to make the alignment correct.\n-Riding impressions. The bike is much quieter than a standard bike on a Kickr. Other drivetrain vibrations are well dampened. Using the app to set up which drivetrain combinations (chainrings and cassette range) is awesome. I can change those to suit the course or race I am riding in Zwift. I use a sweat protector that does obscure the gear setting display; modification to the protector in work. Shifting seems naturally in terms of the change in effort between each gear. \n-Overall this was a good choice. I had been using a Kickr trainer and Climb, along with an older frameset used as a trainer only bike. The Bike is a one piece replacement, which performs equally well if not better, takes ups less floor space, and is easy to move when required. I'm pleased with the purchase so far.",

I am a smaller rider, but fit within the range that Wahoo says the bike is designed for (I am 5'4\"). I am going to hire a bike fitter to come in and sort me out. \n\nAdditionally, this is a small nit, but the screw that holds the seat post quick release sticks out just a mm or two too far, and with every revolution of my leg, it scrapes my the inside of my bibs. It nearly wore a hole in one of my favorite pair before I realized it. I have now covered the screw with a bit of elastic, but it is not an ideal solution.

Setup was super fast and easy. The mobile app that helps to get your geometry to match your regular bike works great. The lack of a need to calibrate the power meter is also really nice. When riding the \n bike the tilting is a nice feature as coaches have told me that the angle of your bike is critical for climbing training adaption. The fact that the stem, handlebar, saddle, seatpost are all standard design is great because its easy to swap out those parts to put your favorite (preferred) parts in thos locations. (Which is what I did) Now for things to improve... The saddle is uncomfortable. I'd suggest changing it out to one with a cut out. I ended up putting a cheap Specialized Power Saddle on mine, and its a vast improvement. Wahoo should make a cut out saddle standard on the bike. Overall the bike is a little more flexy than I would like. Out of the saddle sprinting causes the bike to creak quite a bit. I think that the head tube of the bike could have been made much more robust. The real brake levers are a really nice feature. I've programed mine to match the di2 set up on my bike, however the shape of the lever body is a little funky making it impossible to create a flat transition from the top of the handlebar to the top of the lever body. There is a slight dip in the top of the lever body which is uncomfortable when your hands are on the hoods. I'd re-design the lever body so that the top of the lever body doesnt have a dip in it. Ive also changed out the handlebar for one that is wider (44cm) and with an ergonomic bend.",
